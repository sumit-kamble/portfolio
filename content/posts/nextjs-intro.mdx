# ðŸš€ Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a **powerful React framework** that enables **server-side rendering
(SSR)**, **static site generation (SSG)**, and **API routes** out of the box.
It's the go-to choice for building modern web applications.

## ðŸ”¥ Why Use Next.js?

âœ… **Fast Rendering** â€“ Supports SSR, SSG, and ISR for performance.  
âœ… **Built-in API Routes** â€“ No need for a separate backend.  
âœ… **Automatic Code Splitting** â€“ Optimizes loading speed.  
âœ… **SEO Friendly** â€“ Pre-renders pages for better search rankings.

## ðŸ›  Installing Next.js

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
cd my-next-app
npm run dev
```
